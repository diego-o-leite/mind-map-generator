# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECURE API KEY CONFIGURATION
#
# If you're simply downloading the code (no version control):
# 1. Rename this file from 'example_keys.env' to 'keys.env'.
# 2. Replace 'place_here_your_google_api_key' below with your actual Google API key.
#
# If you're using version control (e.g., Git):
# 1. Configure .gitignore:
#    - Open or create a '.gitignore' file in the root directory of your project.
#    - Add the following line to the file: keys.env
#    - Save the '.gitignore' file.
# 2. Create and configure keys.env:
#    - Create a new file named 'keys.env' in the same folder as this file.
#    - Copy the contents of this file (including this comment) into 'keys.env'.
#    - In 'keys.env', replace 'place_here_your_google_api_key' with your actual Google API key.
#
# IMPORTANT: Never share the 'keys.env' file - it should remain only in your local environment.
# Ensure 'keys.env' is listed in your '.gitignore' file to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.
# Regularly check that your API keys are not exposed in your version control history.
